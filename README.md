# Analysis of Kickstarter Data

This Repository holds the data and notebooks for an Analysis of Kickstarter Projects.
During the Data Science Nanodegree of Udacity, we (the students) were supposed to write a Medium Blog Post for an Analysis we chose.
As a topic for my analsis and Blog Post I chose the Kickstarter Platform since I'm really interested into the projects which are launched there.
The notebook "Result of Analysis.ipynb" contains the questions I asked myself during the explorative analysis (sadly I deleted most of the exploration notebooks, the leftovers are in the directory "explorative").

If you want to read the Blog Post, you can find it here: https://medium.com/@lernen.johanneshoetter/analysis-of-kickstarter-projects
