# Analysis of Kickstarter Data

### Short Description / Project Motivation
This Repository holds the data and notebooks for an Analysis of Kickstarter Projects.
During the Data Science Nanodegree of Udacity, we (the students) were supposed to write a Medium Blog Post for an Analysis we chose.
As a topic for my analysis and Blog Post I chose the Kickstarter Platform since I'm really interested into the projects which are launched there. If you want to, feel free to take a look at the "Result of Analysis.ipynb" Notebook, in which I share some insights I made during the project - little spoiler: there are some trends which can be found for successful projects!

### Installation
To run the notebooks on your local machine you need to install Numpy, Pandas and Scikit-Learn. If you are unfamiliar with those packages or don't know how to install them, check out https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/. Using pip it's as simple as running "pip install numpy", "pip install pandas" and "pip install -U scikit-learn" - make sure you're using a Python Version >= 2.7 !
Another way (which I'd recommend if you're interested into working with several Data Science projects) is to use Anaconda. It comes with most of the necessary packages pre-installed.

### File Descriptions
The notebook "Result of Analysis.ipynb" contains the questions I asked myself during the explorative analysis (sadly I deleted most of the exploration notebooks, the leftovers are in the directory "explorative").
The raw data (a csv file) can be found in the directory "data", the directory "misc" only holds an image of the kickstarter logo.

### Acknowledgments
The data has been downloaded from the Platform Kaggle, which is the most popular platform for getting data for Data Science and Machine Learning Projects. The data has - of course - been provided by Kickstarter.
